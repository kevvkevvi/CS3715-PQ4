This project is a website that is meant to replace another similar website.
The purpose of the website is to show events and information about those
events. The project can be run as an html page by opening the index.html
page, or by connecting to the github hosted site.

The config.yml file has no purpose towards the project, it simply sets the
theme for our workspace.

The collapsible.js file is used to implement the collapsing ability of the
"Open Search" section of the website. This section will show any events from
the main list that are relevent to the search query.

The index.html file is the main body of the project. This includes all of
the code necessary for running the file and building the webpage.

The main.css file contains all of the formatting and coloring for the website. this includes padding between the edge of the page, between different objects, etc.

Finally the search.jss file implements the search bar on the main page. This search bar will filter out irrelevent events from the "Open Search" drop down.
